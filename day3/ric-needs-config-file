oran$ kubectl -n ric get pods -w
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
near-rt-ric-55d7bf95f6-56vls 0/1 CrashLoopBackOff 2 (18s ago) 34s

Observations:
The pod is in CrashLoopBackOff because it’s missing the config file. But, the binary itself is working.
The RIC works perfectly inside the container. It just needs the config file in /usr/local/etc/flexric/flexric.conf.

Next step: 
Debug this error.
